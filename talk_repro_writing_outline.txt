Talk: Reproducible Paper Writing.

DGPS, Sept. 2016, 8-10 min.!!

Storyline:
- What is reproducible paper writing?
	- write paper as plain text (text file)
	- tie data analytic code to right place in paper
	
- Why should I write my paper reproducicibly?
	- for community: data computation code easier to results as stated in you paper
	- for yourself: if something (data) changes, your paper will be update itself. No copy-pasting etc.
	
- How to do it?
	- process: [plain text and R code]Â + style sheet --> pdf/html/doc
	- use RStudio (under the hood: knitr+markdown+pandoc)
	- use style sheets (eg., my thesis stylesheet or papaja for APA papers)
	
- I am still not convinced
